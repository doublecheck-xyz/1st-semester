# Example default_hostgroup settings
#
# Must be placed in ~foreman/config/settings.plugins.d/
#
# :facts_map:
#   <hostgroup>:
#     <fact_name>: <regex>
#
# The Hostgroup is the full label, include any Parent Hostgroups, eg Base/Redhat
#
# The regex can be written either with or without the enclosing slashes:
#   ^test$      - valid
#   /^test$/    - also valid
#
# List the regexes in the order of prority, you can have as many as you like. The
# first one to match will be used. Debug statements are written to the log if you
# are getting the wrong group applied.
